# Dual VCA

![Dual VCA](./assets/images/dual_vca_sq.jpg){width="400", align="right"}

A dual VCA module based on the LM13700 in the Eurorack format.

* Module size: 2HP (10mm)
* Power: 10mA (+12V); 10mA (-12V)

The control voltage (CV) of the VCA can be connected to the envelope from an ADSR. This VCA is designed to connect to the 555-based ADSRs (8V peak envelope voltage).
